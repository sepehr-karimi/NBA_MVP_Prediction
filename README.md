## Description

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for upcoming seasons. It utilizes historical NBA player statistics and MVP voting data to build a predictive model. The project demonstrates the use of web scraping, data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and classification algorithms to make predictions. It is useful for anyone interested in data science, machine learning, or basketball analytics.

## Features

Key features of this project include:

- Web scraping of NBA player statistics and MVP voting data.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the collected data.
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, LDA, KNN, and Decision Tree.
- Evaluation of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
